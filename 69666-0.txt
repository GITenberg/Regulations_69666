It was only the dew-god making a monstrous noise off in the darkness,
but Fahnes allowed his eyes to open and he halfway sat up. There was a
shaded light over by Boles' bunk, and Boles was fussily arranging his
kit for a journey to the trading-center in the Lamphian hills. Food,
canteens, and the trading-stuff, these things would be left at the
untended mart in exchange for a new lot of _llossa_ fiber, which
on Earth was equal in exchange pound for pound with platinum.

Fahnes made an apologetic noise as Boles whirled at his movement. Boles
snorted indignantly.

"It's just one of them gods," he said scornfully. "They make a racket
like that before dawn every mornin'."

Fahnes made himself grin sheepishly, as if half-awake. He knew about
the dew-god. He had more brains than Boles, and he knew more than Boles
about all the things that really mattered on Oryx, though he'd only
been on the small planet five months. Because of his knowledge, he'd
been awake for hours, feverishly debating with himself whether as a
matter of common-sense he had not better murder Boles this morning.
There were reasons for killing him, but it would be satisfying to let
Boles come back from the Lamphian hills to find the trading-post in
ashes, the Honkie village a mere black scar on the green surface of
Oryx, and the supply-ship come and gone.

It would be amusing, too, to picture Boles trying to live on Oryx
without supplies from Earth until another ship came to reestablish
trade. Fahnes inclined not to do murder, this morning, so Boles could
learn what a fool he'd been. Meanwhile Boles regarded him in a superior
fashion.

"I know," said Fahnes. He yawned, now. "But the racket does seem louder
than usual, this morning. I wonder--"

"Regulations say native customs an' religions ain't to be messed with,"
said Boles inflexibly. "You ain't paid to wonder. Quit it."

Boles checked off his equipment on a list. Then he glanced at
the instrument-bank and laboriously began to copy the regulation
before-dawn observations into the post's log-book. Temperature.
Humidity--always from 97 to 100 per cent in the day time, but sometimes
dropping to a conservative 90 at night. Ionization-constant of the air.
Fahnes watched the ironic zest. A lot of good these observations were!

He said impatiently, "I can fix the log, Boles. I'm going to do it
while you're gone."

"While I'm here," said Boles dogmatically, "regulations say I got to do
it. When I'm gone, regulations say you do it. You stick to regulations,
Fahnes, an' you'll get along."

       *       *       *       *       *

The unholy racket which was the dew-god off beyond the jungle seemed
to grow louder yet. No man, it was said in the _Instructions
for Oryx_, had ever yet seen a dew-god. But the native deities
were of extreme importance to the Honkies, and the maintenance of
trade-relations required that their religion should be undisturbed.

"Blister it!" said Fahnes, in private irony but seeming peevishness. "I
wish regulations would let a man do something about that racket. It's
tough to be waked up every morning by some kind of Honkie god with a
voice like sixteen steam-whistles in different keys all going at once."

Boles struggled into his waterproof garments. On Oryx, where it never
rains, one naturally wears waterproof clothing.

"Listen here!" said Boles firmly. "You get this! Before this post was
set up, the Comp'ny had a survey-party on Oryx for months. You read
the report. They studied the place, an' the natives, an' they made up
regulations for this special planet. They're good regulations. You
follow 'em an' you'll do all right. Same way with the Honkies.

"They found out, somehow, what hadda be done to get along. They didn't
do it scientific, but like human people did back in the old days. They
didn't call what they found out regulations. They called it religion.
But it works. It's good regulations, for Honkies. You get the idea that
Honkie religion is good regulations for them, an' ain't to be meddled
with. Then you won't get into no trouble."

"I assure you," said Fahnes sarcastically, "I shan't try to make the
Honkies atheists."

"Yeah," said Boles. "That's it. Don't."

Boles zipped his suit shut. He began to struggle into the various
straps which would hold the articles of his equipment about him. Fahnes
watched with concealed amusement. The Honkie religion was not to be
meddled with?

The windows of the trading-post rattled from a sudden special uproar
from the god. He, Fahnes, knew things about the Honkie religion that
Boles didn't, that the survey-party, apparently, hadn't found out. Gods
which roared in the darkness could arouse the curiosity even of a man
like Fahnes, who despised such stupidities as gods and regulations.
Fahnes had taken satisfaction in breaking the regulations about Honkies
under Boles' very nose. He'd set up a camera and flash-bulb and
trigger-string off where the dew-god roared even now and he, Fahnes,
had a photograph of a dew-god.

The blinding flash of the flash-bulb had startled it. It had crashed
into a jungle-tree in its flight. And at the scene of the accident--the
crystal was in the pocket of Fahnes' sleeping-suit--he'd found a
memento of Honkie religion. It had been torn from the headdress of the
dew-god. The photograph of the dew-god told how many more such mementos
the dew-god wore in his headdress. So Fahnes had planned murder for
this morning, and was still in two minds about its necessity. The
prospects before him were enough to make a man giddy.

But he wasn't giddy. His plan was carefully worked out. It was so
brilliant that he'd honestly regretted that nobody would ever know how
magnificent it had been. But there'd been two breaks--one a space-radio
message and the other this decision of Boles' to make the trip. Fahnes
could leave Boles alive to realize his situation, if he chose. When
Boles came back, six days from now, he'd understand. Not completely,
perhaps, but a memento--a small one, left on a stick where he'd be sure
to see it--would enable him to piece out the story bit by bit as he
tried hopelessly to live until another ship came to rebuild human trade
on Oryx.

Boles was festooned with all the impedimenta that regulations said
should be carried on any journey on Oryx. It was still dead-dark
outside. The dew-god still roared, though more faintly now.

"All right," said Boles curtly. "I'm off. Mind, you stick to
regulations while I'm gone!"

"Just which ones do you think I'm planning to break?" asked Fahnes
ironically. "The ones about leaving native women alone?"

Boles shook his head, unsmiling. Oryx females, with a greenish,
semi-chitinous skin, were definitely not appealing to humans.

"Nope," said Boles heavily. "But you ain't got the right attitude.
Regulations got sense behind 'em--even the Honkie regulations that
they think are religion. Maybe I'd better--" He hesitated, and Fahnes
knew coldly that Boles' life hung in the balance without his knowing
anything at all about it. "Oh, well," Boles said at last, and thereby
removed the need for murder. "I guess you'll make out. So long."

       *       *       *       *       *

He went out of the door and closed it behind him. Fahnes heard small
splashings in between the dew-god's roarings. There was never any rain
on Oryx. Never. So by dawn the jungle-trees were coated with dew in
monstrous droplets. Boles, moving through the supple growths, marched
sturdily under a constant waterfall from the trees, his progress
disturbed.

Then Fahnes laughed softly to himself. He took his hand from below the
dry-blanket a man has to sleep under, on Oryx, if he isn't to wake in a
pool of water. He had a bolt-pistol in his fingers. All the time Boles
talked, there'd been that bolt-pistol ready to kill him. Perhaps--just
possibly--it had been a mistake to let him live. But he'd gone off
unarmed, anyhow. There was no need of weapons on Oryx. The Honkies
didn't kill things. Their religion forbade it. And besides men had
red blood like Honkies, and there was a religious prohibition against
Honkies ever looking at anything which was red.

Fahnes got up and made an adjustment on the space-radio. It had
been silent for four days--since he heard the first notice from the
supply-ship that it was ten days ahead of schedule and would arrive
before Boles expected it. He still didn't expect it, because Fahnes
hadn't told him. And he'd gone off, now, and the ship would have come
and gone and many things would have happened before his return. Now
Fahnes readjusted the set for reception and dressed leisurely, smiling
to himself.

Off through the jungle, the noise of the dew-god died away. Fahnes
glanced through the trading-post window. There was grayness to the
east where the local sun rose. No coloring at all. Just light. As he
watched, the white disk of the sun appeared. There was never any rain
on Oryx, and the reason for that anomaly also prevented colorings in
the sky at dawn and sunset.

Oryx was a magnesium planet. Magnesium was omnipresent on its surface,
as sodium is everywhere on Earth. The chloride was the common compound.
And just as on earth there is salt in some concentration everywhere, so
on Oryx there was magnesium chloride in the body-fluids of the Honkies
and the insects--there were no animals to speak of--and in the sap of
the trees, and impregnated in every particle of the soil. The results
were outstanding, because magnesium chloride is deliquescent to a high
degree.[1]

[Footnote 1: (Note.) A deliquescent substance is one which absorbs
moisture from the air until it can dissolve in the water it has
collected.]

       *       *       *       *       *

Everything on Oryx, therefore, attracted moisture to itself, and held
it. Everything on the planet was at least moist. If dust were formed by
some extraordinary event, it could not remain dust on the ground. It
would stick, because of dampness.

So there was no dust on Oryx, and since there was no dust, there could
be no sunset or sunrise coloring, no condensation of moisture on
dust-particles to form clouds, and therefore no rain. And since there
could be no rain there could be no brooks, ponds, pools, or lakes. The
jungle covered everything, watered by dew which could only condense on
solid substances because there was nothing else for it to condense on.

It was not a pleasant environment for men, but the Honkies lived in
it contentedly with their soapstone implements and houses, and their
elaborate religion with its ceremonies and taboos. Their culture was
low. They had no fire, because there had never been lightning to show
them that such a thing could be. They had no metals, because metals
cannot be smelted without a fire. They lived a life of elaborate ritual.

Even the location of their villages was determined by a religious
abhorrence of the color red. Cultivation of land with a red-clay
under-soil was therefore impossible. But the local village was safe
against accidental impiety. The fields in which the dew-god had roared
were of a slaty-blue, sticky soil which Fahnes knew by experience was
incredibly adhesive until the sun dried it.

He breakfasted comfortably. So far he had not done a single overt
act save the muting of the space-radio, and that could not ever be
proved. He had not murdered Boles. He could drop everything, make a
formal report to the Company on what he had discovered, and undoubtedly
receive a promotion and a few hundred credits a year more pay. He was
enormously amused at the stupidity of which some men would be capable,
when they could do as he was going to, and spend the rest of his life
in the luxury and lavish enjoyment only unlimited riches could provide.
But Fahnes, of course, was very clever. He approved of himself very
much.

He finished his breakfast and looked out again. The sun was just two
diameters high and the top of the jungle was a scintillating glory.
Huge dew-drops covered every leaf. Each reflected all the rays of the
sun. The landscape seemed covered with diamonds, save where Boles
had marched. The jungle-trees he'd touched in passing were no longer
jewel-studded. Their movements as he pushed them aside had made the
dew coalesce and run down. His trail was clear. He had gone on to the
Lamphian hills.

The restored space-radio muttered curtly:

    CHECK FOR ORYX TRADING-POST. COURSE AND SPEED HELD. WE WILL LAND
    AT YOUR POST IN THIRTY-TWO HOURS FIFTEEN MINUTES, EARTH MEASURE.

It was a repeat-notification from the supply-ship on the way.

That was the last thing Fahnes needed to be sure of. He buckled the
pistol-belt about him. He went into the store-room and opened a
soldered case in which a flame-rifle had remained in store since the
post was opened. He cleaned it carefully. He loaded it from ammunition
packed with it. He went to the store-room door and aimed at the jungle.
He pulled trigger.

There was a ten-yard circle of pure devastation. Smoke poured up.
Then it stopped. Smoke-particles do not remain smoke in air which is
super-saturated with moisture. Water condenses upon them. They become
droplets of mist. The mist becomes rain. An appreciable shower fell
upon the smouldering jungle-spot. The smouldering embers went out.

Fahnes grinned. He had not anticipated that, but it was amusing.
Everything was amusing today. The sun rose higher and the glittering
dew evaporated. It did not form a mist, but made the air actually thick
to breathe. Fahnes remembered an authoritative lecture from Boles. Each
dew-drop, said Boles, was a tiny burning-glass as long as it remained.
Until it dried up it focused morning sunlight on the leaf under it,
scorching its own support. So the roaring of the dew-god every morning,
so loud that leaves vibrated near it, shook the dew-drops into flowing
fluid which ran off. The Honkie crops, then, weren't scorched. But
without the dew-god, the Honkies would starve.

       *       *       *       *       *

Fahnes slung the flame-rifle over his shoulder, made sure the
bolt-pistol was ready for action, and marched off toward the Honkie
village. There were four or five hundred Honkies in the soapstone
huts of the settlement. They were greenish in tint, and while their
skin was not in actual plates like insects, it was thick and stiff
and really flexible only at the joints. They were solemn-faced and
quiet and lived their whole lives in impassioned absorption in their
religion, as Boles lived his in devotion to regulations. Boles said
that their religion was regulations, and that it made sense. But Fahnes
had no religion, and he heeded no regulations save those he made
himself.

The jungle dried about him as he walked. There was no longer the
sensation of walking under a traveling shower-bath. It was--save for
the wet thickness of the air--not uncomfortable. In half an hour he
reached the slaty-blue soil on which the crops of the Honkie village
were grown. He grinned excitedly and began to cross it toward the
village. But he found himself slackening his pace to look at the soil
absorbedly.

He realized, and chuckled to himself. He needn't look for mementos in
the ground, here! The Honkies would have attended to that for him! He
continued to grin as he pressed on. He was in open sunshine, now, with
shoulder-high plants about him and the huddled soapstone huts of the
village in clear view ahead. And he saw Honkies in the fields. They
were working the crops. They used preposterously-shaped hoes and dug
busily around the plants which formed their food-supply.

Out of the corner of his eye Fahnes saw them look at him, but he could
never catch one actually in the act of staring. He'd expected protests,
and the flame-rifle was ready, but whenever he jerked his head about,
the Honkie he essayed to catch was absorbed in his agricultural labor.

This, of course, was unexpected. It was forbidden for humans to
enter Honkie villages. The Company regulations by which Boles lived
specifically forbade it under any and all conditions. It was a
violation of basic principle. Men must not enter Honkie villages! It
was forbidden by Honkie religion!

For a man to enter a Honkie village was sacrilege. It was blasphemy! It
was crime! But the Honkies seemingly pretended not to notice. Fahnes
grew irritated. He was ready to use the flame-gun to force his way
in, after what he knew was there. He was prepared to deal out murder
wholesale. His intention to commit what the regulations called crime
was obvious. But the Honkies feigned obliviousness.

They grew thicker as he neared the village. Male Honkies. Female
Honkies. Smaller ones--male and female indiscriminately--scuttled
about the taller figures who were adults. All eyed him furtively and
knew that he committed sacrilege against their gods in approaching
a village. None made any gesture, any actual sign, which really
acknowledged his existence. Fahnes stopped short a bare ten feet from a
male Honkie elaborately piling up dirt around the root-stock of a plant.

"My friend," said Fahnes ironically, knowing the Honkie would not
understand, "I admire your industry. But isn't it a bit futile?
Shouldn't you defend your gods and hearth and home? Don't you realize
that I'm going into your village? Don't you even suspect I intend to
rob your loudest-voiced god? In short, don't you think you ought to do
something? Of course, if you do I will certainly kill you, but this
pretense of not noticing me is silly."

The Honkie labored on, his leathery, expressionless face giving no sign
that he heard the man's words. Fahnes grew jumpy, and his eyes turned
ugly for no especial reason.

"What's the matter?" he asked, sneering. "You're afraid for that green
skin of yours? Where's your piety! Here I am about to commit sacrilege
against what I'm assured is a most important religion--and you pretend
not to notice!"

The Honkie hoed on, Fahnes spat suddenly.

"To the devil with you!" he cried violently. He hated the green-skinned
native of Oryx simply because he was about to commit a crime against
the whole tribe. He needed resistance to assure himself of his courage
and cleverness. He craved fear in his victims. He wanted to be able
to live over, in his own mind, a scene of splendid derring-do as the
source of the lavish luxury in which he would live for the rest of his
life. "You're as big a fool as Boles! You and your gods! He and his
regulations! To the devil with all of you!"

       *       *       *       *       *

He glared at the lean, unhuman figure which ploddingly moved on to the
next plant and began to hoe there, having given no sign whatever that
it knew that Fahnes was present.

Fahnes marched on, chewing upon rage. He passed other Honkies. Many
of them. All pretended not to see him. He was definitely not afraid.
The flame-gun could destroy all the Honkies on Oryx, if they tried
to attack him. But he raged because he could not understand this
embarrassed ignoring of his presence.

Then he reached the village. Every house was built of blocks of
soapstone, carved to perfection and ornamented with elaborate designs
for which Fahnes, at this moment, had no taste. The soapstone, Boles
had said, had been brought on Honkie-back for fifty miles or more,
just so the village could be built where there was no red clay under
the soil to be turned up by an incautious hoe. It had stood here for
generations. Perhaps for a thousand years.

It seemed to be deserted, but Fahnes knew better. The Honkies in the
villages were not showing themselves, so that they might the more
effectually pretend that he was not there. It was insult. It was
stupidity. It denied the courage and the cunning and the cleverness of
Fahnes, who had defied Honkie gods and Company regulations to go there
and rob the god who roared hideously in the last hour before dawn.

He unslung the flame-rifle. He'd made his plans carefully, and more
Honkies would not spoil them. White with tension and with unreasonable
rage, he prepared to force the Honkies to play the part he had assigned
them. The trick would be the swift and murderous use of destruction to
clear the village of those who remained in it in hiding, and to force
them to fury against him.

A brisk looting of the temple of the dew-god, facing him where he
stood, would follow, and then a completely ruthless march back to the
trading-post, using the flame-gun mercilessly to make his retreat
secure, yet so sparingly that the maddened Honkies would yet have hopes
of overwhelming him for his sacrilege and murder.

When the supply-ship dropped from the sky, the Honkies would be
besieging the trading-post. His tale of a religious frenzy beginning
with the murder of Boles--who was not murdered at all--would be
convincing. Under regulations, there would be nothing for the
supply-ship skipper to do but evacuate the trading-post, carrying
Fahnes and the loot he'd have hidden, to the nearest civilized plant,
where he would vanish utterly, with wealth incalculable.

And he'd demand that the skipper give the village a bath in
take-off-jet flame as the supply-ship rose skyward. With the tale
he'd tell, that would be a certainty. It would prove his rage,
because normally only a man in frenzy demands revenge, and Boles had
an extraordinary popularity among the employees of the Consolidated
Trading Company.

He fired. Coruscating flame enveloped the nearest house. There was
the roar of suddenly-expanded air and of burning. A second blast of
ravening destruction. A third--a fourth!

He saw a few, furtive, fugitive movements. The Honkies in the village
had fled. They were still fleeing. His scheme was working as it would
continue to work, and as Boles would some day figure it out with a
single crystalline memento of the Honkie religion left behind for him,
as an overwhelmingly lucid clue.

Fahnes now had the village utterly to himself. Swearing horribly for no
cause, his throat dry and his eyes raging, he went into the temple of
the dew-god to acquire the riches he knew were there. They had to be
there. A brainy man like Fahnes had worked out, from a photograph of
a dew-god from whose headdress a glittering crystal had dropped, from
blue clay like the blue clay of Kimberley, on Earth, and from sheer
logic, a brainy man like Fahnes had worked out an absolutely air-tight
case proving that there was wealth incalculable in the temple.

       *       *       *       *       *

The antiquity of the village only increased the estimate. Honkies
had cultivated the blue-clay fields for probably a thousand years.
Worshipping the dew-god, and finding bright crystals which looked like
solidified dew-drops and reflected the sun as the dew did, surely they
would make votive offerings of such crystals!

He wore strings of them upon his headdress! Fahnes had one in his
pocket now, dropped by the god when frightened by a flash-bulb! Even
the headdress would make Fahnes rich, but it was mathematically certain
that for a thousand years every Honkie had devoutly turned over to the
temple every rough diamond found in the growing-fields. And a thousand
years of such devoutness, would mean untold wealth.

He fired the flame-gun again from sheer destructiveness, then went
snarling into the temple, ready to deal out death to anyone who dared
to dispute anything with him.

[Illustration: Fahnes fired the flame-gun again, then strode into the
temple.]

       *       *       *       *       *

The tall Honkie squatted on the ground outside the trading-post and
worriedly mouthed his few words of Terrestrial speech. Boles listened
with an air of indignation.

"Your runner caught up to me an' brought me back," Boles said
dogmatically. "Accordin' to regulations I got to help you out any way I
can. But this is bad!"

The Honkie struggled again to convey his meaning in Earth language.
Then he fell back upon his own tongue.

"Lord," he said with dignity. "It was the dew-god's doing. We do not
understand. The man came through our fields, approaching our village.
And this was against the Law, so all our people pretended not see, lest
he be shamed. Yet he had no shame even in breaking the Law. He shouted
at us in the fields. He went to the village, where again those who were
present pretended not to see. Then he took an instrument we know not
and struck houses with it, destroying everything."

"A flame-gun," said Boles, scowling. "This is goin' to make trouble. He
busted regulations."

"He went into the temple of the dew-god," the worried Honkie chieftain
went on with dignified emphasis, "and there are bright stones which
look like the dew, save that they do not vanish in the sunlight. They
are also hard, and we carve our bowls and houses with them. But often,
because they are like the dew, we give them to the dew-god. The man
seemed to desire them greatly. He tore them from the walls of the
temple where they are set. And then he saw the inner part of the temple
where the dew-god's holiness stays. We had put the most beautiful of
the bright stones there, and the dew-god's holiness covered them. But
the man desired the stones so greatly that he threw himself into the
dew-god's holiness, and he could not endure it. So he died."

"The dew-god's holiness, eh?" said Boles skeptically.

"The dew-god," said the Honkie chief practically, "shakes the dew
from our crops before dawn, so that they do not change color and grow
uneatable like the wild things of the jungle. One of us, each morning,
carries his headdress and blows his horn for him among the crops. As
the dew falls from the leaves it hurries to the dew-god's temple.
Each morning dew-drops by millions run into his temple and gather in
a great, deep gathering which is the holiness of the dew-god. And we
place the brightest stones there to welcome them."

Boles blinked. Then he jumped.

"Holy?" he cried. "The dew's like a rainstorm, shook off all at once,
an' you got a drainage system. Sure! You got a dewpond in the temple!
A lake! A swimmin'-pool, full of shook-off dew. An' bright stones were
there?"

"Lord, the bright stones are covered by the holiness for a large
space," said the Honkie chieftain apologetically. "And the man seemed
to desire them greatly. If we had understood, we would have given them
to him. We bring them from a great distance, but it is our religion
freely to give one another the things that are most desirable. If it
is the custom of men to desire those bright stones, we would surrender
them."

       *       *       *       *       *

Boles looked at the glittering handful of crystals he had taken from
the pockets of Fahnes, after the Honkies had brought him back.

"It ain't worth while," he said vexedly. "'They' what man call zircons.
'They' pretty, but there ain't any value to 'em for trade. 'They' just
hard enough to use as tools to cut soapstones. Fahnes thought they were
diamonds, I guess. When he saw a swimming-pool carpeted with diamonds
on the bottom he went outa his head. He dived for 'em. An' the pool's
prob'ly deeper than it looks. He hopped in to grab zircons he thought
was diamonds, an' there wasn't any steps like a swimmin'-pool should
have, an' he couldn't get out again. So he drowned--on Oryx, where it
never rains. Good grief!"

"The dew-god destroyed him because he broke the law," said the Honkie
respectfully.

"He died because he was a fool who didn't keep to regulations," said
Boles caustically.

There was a booming noise overhead. It grew and grew in volume.
It became a monstrous roar. It was so loud that the leaves of the
jungle-trees quivered.

The supply-ship descended smoothly, creating a tumult which seemed to
shake the very ground. And Boles stood up and clenched his fists in the
ultimate of exasperation.

"He musta known this!" Boles cried furiously. "He knew the ship was
comin' in ahead of schedule. It was his job to listen on space-radio
when news comes through. But he didn't tell me, an' me with no stuff
packed for shipment an' due to catch tarnation for holdin' up the ship!
Blast him! It's his fault. He shoulda kept to regulation."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
